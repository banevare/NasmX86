# Generate and run Intel Avx512 assembler code from Perl

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/Nasmx86/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This Perl module generates and runs Intel Avx512 assembler code. It contains
methods to perform useful macro functions such as dumping x/y/zmm* registers to
facilitate the debugging of the generated code.

The githubaction in this repo shows how to install nasm and the intelsde used
to assemble and then run the generated code.
