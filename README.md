# Generate and run https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512 assembler programs from Perl

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/Nasmx86/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This Perl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming generates and runs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512 assembler programs. It contains
methods to perform useful macro functions such as dumping x/y/zmm* registers to
facilitate the debugging of the generated programs.

The https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart in this repo shows how to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs) https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm and the https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html used
to assemble and then run the programs generated by this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming. 
Test cases can be seen at the end of **lib/Nasm/X86.pm**.  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing cases are
run by the https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart.
