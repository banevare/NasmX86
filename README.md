# Generate and run [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) assembler programs from Perl

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/Nasmx86/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This Perl [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) generates and runs [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) [Advanced Vector Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) assembler programs. It contains
methods to perform useful macro functions such as dumping x/y/zmm* registers to
facilitate the debugging of the generated programs.

The [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart) in this repo shows how to [install](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)) [nasm](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) and the [Intel Software Development Emulator](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html) used
to assemble and then run the programs generated by this [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). 
Test cases can be seen at the end of **lib/Nasm/X86.pm**.  The [test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) cases are
run by the [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart).
