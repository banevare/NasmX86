# Generate and run Intel Avx512 assembler ![programming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) from Perl

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/Nasmx86/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This Perl ![module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) generates and runs Intel Avx512 assembler ![programming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). It contains
methods to perform useful macro functions such as dumping x/y/zmm* registers to
facilitate the debugging of the generated ![programming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). 
The ![GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart) in this repo shows how to ![install](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)) ![nasm](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) and the ![Intel Software Development Emulator](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html) used
to assemble and then run the generated ![programming code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program).
